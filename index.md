<h2>Barriston Law Client Portal Application</h2>

This was a private/in-house project with the Barriston Law Group that involved creating a web application with Express and Node.js. Law clerks could sign up a client and request specific forms from them to fill out. The client is given an email link and then can login to fill out the forms, which are saved to mongoDB and the information is then used to fill out word documents that are available to download for the clerk to use. All form data was stored in mongoDB.
Unfortunately I cannot share the site or repository as the client wanted it to be kept private, but screenshots are shown below.

This application allows a user to login through gmail or regular email and choose characters to view information about them in the game, including win rates, items and runes. The application was developed in Android Studio, and used Firebase to store and retrieve the data as well as manage logins.
