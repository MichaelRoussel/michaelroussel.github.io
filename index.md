<h2>Barriston Law Client Portal Application</h2>

This was a private/in-house project that involved creating a web application with express and Node.js. Law clerks could sign up a client and request specific forms from them to fill out. The client is given an email link and then can login to fill out the forms, which are saved to mongoDB and the information is then used to fill out word documents that are available to download for the clerk to use. 
Unfortunately I cannot share the site or repository as the client wanted it to be kept private, but screenshots are shown below.
